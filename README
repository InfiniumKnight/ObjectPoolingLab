There is an object pooler that instantiates bullets as needed but attempts to reuse them where possible. The bullets send themselves back to the pool when they
hit a target or are flying for 3 seconds. For the observer, I have a game manager script that updates the score when a target dies by the target sending a call to the
Gamemanager's UpdateScore method. The Builder is handled by a class that randomly selects one of three target type prefabs and one of three spawnpoints. each target
inherits from the Target behavior class which handles most of the target type's functionality. The only thing the unique child classes due is assign the values of
the inherited TargetBehavior Varliables.
